# pRNG - Alphanumeric id generator.
Pseudo-Random Number Generator for alphanumeric ids.

This is an alternative to UUIDs, generating random strings of characters > 10 characters in length.  This uses only A-Z, a-z, and 0-9.  It was written specifically for a client request, I personally prefer UUIDs.
